# PI_Day-Challenge
Attempting Pi Day challenge by Daniel Shiffman by programming the Apollonian Gasket

# Introduction
I am a huge fan of the number Pi and this year I decided to finally attempt the Pi day challenge by attempting to recreate the Apollonian Gasket.
I will be referencing the [coding train challenge page](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/182-apollonian-gasket) to do so.

This will be attemptimg to create an Apollonian Gasket using the Descartes Circle Theorem and complex numbers.
